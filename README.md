# Scoreboard

A very simple leaderboard page to keep track of points during a game with multiple participants.

## How to use
Just open the `scoreboard.html` file in a web browser. 
You can click on the names to add points as participants answer questions correctly.

This can also be prepared by uploading a JSON file with participant names.
