# Scoreboard
A very simple leaderboard page to keep track of points during a game with multiple participants.


## How to use
Just open the index.html file in a web browser, via live-server. 
You can click on the names to add points as participants answer questions correctly.

This can also be prepared by uploading a JSON file with participant names.

See the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) for detailed instructions.
