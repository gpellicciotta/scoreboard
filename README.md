# Scoreboard

A very simple leaderboard page to keep track of points during a game with multiple participants.

## How to use
Just open the `scoreboard.html` file in a web browser. 
You can click on the names to add points as participants answer questions correctly.

This can also be prepared by uploading a JSON file with participant names.

## Available actions

- Click on a participant's "+" or "-" buttons to add or subtract a point.
- Use the "Reset Scores" button to set all scores back to zero.
- Click the "Auto-sort" button to toggle automatic sorting of participants by their scores.
- Use the "Export" button to download the current scores as a JSON file.
- Use the "Import" button to upload a JSON file with participant names and scores.
- Use the "Save to Cloud" button to save the current scores to a cloud service.
- Use the "Load from Cloud" button to load scores from a cloud service.
- Click the "Configure" button to directly edit the configuration JSON.
- Click the "Finish Game" button to end the game and display the final winner message via a configured URL.
